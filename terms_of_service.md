# Terms of Service

_Last Updated: [01/20/25]_

Welcome to our **GPT STAT BOT** service! By using this bot, you acknowledge and agree to these terms and conditions (“Terms”). Please read them carefully before using the bot’s functionality.

---

## 1. Introduction and Scope

These Terms of Service (“Terms”) govern your access to and use of the **GPT STAT BOT** (“Service”). By using the Service, you agree to comply with these Terms. If you do not agree, you may not access or use the Service.

This Service is a private **Helldivers 2 alliance** tool intended for use by participating Discord servers. Server owners or administrators who invite this bot must ensure that all users of the Service comply with these Terms and with Discord’s [Terms of Service](https://discord.com/terms).

The **GPT STAT BOT** has a singular command, `/extract`, which uses Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to read data from **full-screen mission stats screenshots** in Helldivers 2. These valuable stats inform the alliance command about the progress of the war.

## 2. User Obligations

By using the **GPT STAT BOT**, you agree to:

1. **Use the `/extract` command responsibly** and in accordance with alliance guidelines, showing consideration, professionalism, and sensitivity.  
2. **Verify the accuracy** of any submitted screenshots before issuing the `/extract` command.  
   - The bot is approximately **99.9% accurate** but currently best supports **1280×800** and **1920×1080** (including standard scaling) screenshots.  
   - Future updates will include a patch to support widescreen screenshots.  
3. **Double-check** the bot’s extracted stats against the original screenshot. If you notice any inaccuracies, **DM “Black Snow”** or wait until the weekly manual audit (Sundays) by the GPT staff team to correct data in the database.  
4. Ensure that your use of the Service does not violate any applicable laws or regulations, nor Discord’s Terms of Service.  
5. Use the Service in a manner that does not disrupt or impair its functionality for others.

- Reverse engineering, hacking, or attempting to disrupt or manipulate the bot’s code or data.  
- Submitting unlawful, defamatory, or offensive content.  
- Exploiting vulnerabilities, using automated tools, or engaging in any activity that grants an unfair advantage to yourself or others.

## 4. Liability Disclaimers

1. The **GPT STAT BOT** is provided “as is” without warranties of any kind, express or implied.  
2. The Service does **not** guarantee the accuracy, reliability, or availability of the content it produces, especially if screenshots are unclear or incorrectly formatted.  
3. Use of the Service is at your own risk. To the maximum extent permitted by law, we disclaim all liability for damages arising from your use of the Service, including but not limited to direct, indirect, incidental, or consequential damages.

## 5. Data Collection, Retention, and Privacy

### Data Collected
- **Discord User IDs**: Required for bot functionality and to reference submissions.  
- **Discord Server IDs**: Used to associate the bot’s functionality with specific Discord servers.  
- **Mission Stats (Screenshots)**: The bot reads mission-end stats from full-screen screenshots to populate alliance leaderboards.

### Purpose of Data Collection
- To maintain a database of mission stats for the **#leaderboard** channel in the alliance.  
- To inform the alliance command about war progress and individual contributions.

### Data Retention
- **30-Day Data Purge**: All stat-specific data (e.g., mission screenshots, extracted text) is stored for up to **30 days** and then automatically deleted.  
- **Persistent Data**: Discord IDs and Server IDs may be retained for essential service functions. However, they can be deleted upon request (see below).

### Data Deletion Requests
- You may request the deletion of your submitted stats, Discord User ID, or Server ID at any time.  
- To make a request, contact us using the information in [Section 8](#8-contact-information). We will process deletion requests within a reasonable time frame.

We do **not** sell or share your data with third parties without your explicit consent.

## 6. The `/extract` Command

The **`/extract` command** is the core function of the GPT STAT BOT and must be used with care:

1. **Full-Screen Screenshots Only**: The bot’s OCR is designed for end-mission stats screens in Helldivers 2 using resolutions **1280×800** or **1920×1080**.  
2. **Submission Process**:  
   - Type `/extract` in the relevant channel.  
   - **Paste** your screenshot (e.g., press `Ctrl + Prnt Scrn` followed by `Ctrl + V`) into the command after hitting enter **twice**.  
   - The bot processes this **ephemerally**, minimizing chat clutter.  
   - A dedicated **#submissions** channel is recommended to handle mistakes and for the initial 30-day training period.  
3. **Verify for Accuracy**: Since OCR can be imperfect, users must confirm the extracted stats match the screenshot before final submission.  
4. **Reporting Errors**: If the bot misreads the stats, **DM “Black Snow”** or allow the GPT staff team to audit the data on Sunday.

## 7. Termination

We reserve the right to suspend or terminate your access to the **GPT STAT BOT** at our discretion, without prior notice, if we determine that you have violated these Terms or engaged in prohibited activities. Upon termination, you must cease all use of the Service and remove any related data or content obtained through it.
